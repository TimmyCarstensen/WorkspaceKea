I'm not familiar with
this site but I think anything
with italic blue text (infilename 
and process(str)" is meant to be
pseudocode, aka replaced with the 
actual code for your specific needs.

The "process(str)" is basically pseudocode
for whatever you want to do with the incoming
text; literally it means "here is where you process the string.

Replace "process(str);" with something like 
"vector.add(str);" or "array[x] = str;", basically 
customize it to your needs.

Hope this helps.
